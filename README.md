### INCIDENT site

The backend is being made with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). 

To run on your own machine locally,
    
    $ git clone <the url of this repo>

    $ cd inci-site

    $ . venv/bin/activate

That will activate the virtualenv in which the tools are installed in
Basically an env in which everything needed to run the backend is installed.
Visit [venv docs](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) for more details.

    $ python serve.py 

That will run the server and the site will be available at `localhost:5000`.
